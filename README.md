# Hi, my name is Hendrik Sievers.

I am an electrical engineering student from Germany with a passion for backend development, particularly using the Django web framework in my free time.

Python is my preferred programming language, but I also have experience writing embedded software in C for STM32 microcontrollers.

Currently, I am refining my skills in modeling electrical systems using MATLAB and Simulink. I would also like to learn Go when I have time.
